# R Programming Projects
A collection of projects I've done using R. I have roughly 2 years of experience in processing and analysing data in R. Much of that experience came from research projects I was involved in as an undergraduate psychology student. As most of the data and analyses from those projects are confidential, the projects included here are mostly personal and done for the purpose of upskilling.

To view the R scripts directly, you may click the files above. As I tend to use markdown for nearly all my R projects, you may also click the following links to view them on R-pubs:
- [Customer segmentation using K-means clustering](https://rpubs.com/fdln_aa/cseg)
  - Market segmentation using K-means clustering and the gap statistics. 
  - Packages used: dply, cluster, ggplot2
-[A/B testing](https://rpubs.com/fdln_aa/abtest)
  - A/B testing for a fictional cat adoption website using Chi-square tests of proportions. 
  - Packages used: dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot2
